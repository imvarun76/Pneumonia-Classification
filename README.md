# Pneumonia-Classification
A deep learning project leveraging transfer learning to classify pediatric chest X-rays as either indicative of pneumonia or normal.

Project Overview:

This deep learning project aims to develop an accurate and efficient model for classifying pediatric chest X-rays as either indicative of pneumonia or normal. The project leverages transfer learning, utilizing a pre-trained deep learning model (DenseNet-161) that has been trained on a large dataset and fine-tuning it on the pneumonia classification dataset.

The model architecture is based on a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), modified to suit the specific requirements of pneumonia detection. The training process involves using a labeled dataset of pediatric chest X-rays, followed by evaluation on separate validation and test sets to ensure robustness and generalization.

The ultimate objective is to deploy the model in a real-world clinical setting, assisting healthcare professionals in diagnosing pneumonia in pediatric patients. Early detection through automated analysis has the potential to improve treatment outcomes and reduce the burden on radiologists.

Dataset Used: Pediatric Pneumonia Chest X-ray Dataset (Kaggle)
